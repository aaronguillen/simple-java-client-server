Some socket programming stuff

README updated 13 November 2016

So run two instances of SocketProgramming. For the first, choose the server. Once the server is open for a connection, run another instance of SocketProgramming as a client. They'll connect, chat, and enter "Exit" on the client to *properly* end the session.

If you look at my Diffie-Hellman repository, you'll notice some pretty stark similarities between that and this. That's because I basically copy and pasted code from that project and reorganized it for this one. I've been thinking about the logic for socket programming and wanted to make a more general client-server interaction program, so that's where this came from.

Either way, enjoy.

Of course, version information. Here's the NetBeans/Java info:
